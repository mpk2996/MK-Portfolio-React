      Hello, and thank you for viewing my portfolio. My name is Mike Kehoe, and I am a recent graduate of the University of Miami full-stack web development bootcamp. I live in Indianapolis, Indiana and work with music programs across the country as a percussion arranger, clinician, and educator. I graduated in 2018 from Ball State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Music Education. In my free time, I enjoy exercising, playing music, and performing with the Indianapolis Colts Drumline!
